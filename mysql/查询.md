# 查询

## 使用用户自定义变量
用户自定义变量是一个用来存储内容的临时容器，在与服务端整个连接周期内都有效

```sql
# 使用自定义变量实现排名信息
SET @curr_cnt := 0, @prev_cnt := 0, @rank := 0;
SELECT actor_id,
  @curr_cnt := cnt AS cnt,
  @rank := IF(@prev_cnt <> @curr_cnt, @rank + 1, @rank) AS rank, @prev_cnt := @curr_cnt AS dummy
FROM (
SELECT actor_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM sakila.film_actor
GROUP BY actor_id
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 10
as der;

# 查询刚刚的修改内容
UPDATE t1 SET lastUpdated = NOW() WHERE id = 1 AND @now := NOW();
SELECT @now;

# 统计出现重复主键时插入和更新的计数
INSERT INTO t1(c1, c2) VALUES(4, 4), (2, 1), (3, 1) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE
c1 = VALUES(c1) + ( 0 * ( @x := @x +1 ) );

# lazy union
SELECT GREATEST(@found := −1, id) AS id, 'users' AS which_tbl FROM users WHERE id = 1
UNION ALL
SELECT id, 'users_archived'
FROM users_archived WHERE id = 1 AND @found IS NULL UNION ALL
SELECT 1, 'reset' FROM DUAL WHERE ( @found := NULL ) IS NOT NULL;
```
